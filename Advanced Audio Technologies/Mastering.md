# Mastering Concept

Mastering is a separate process from mixing. But technically; mastering is the creation of the production master. *Edison Wax Cylinder*. Now however, we create different kind of masters.

EQ/Filters/Dynamics are carefully applied to make sure everything “fits in”.

Crest Factor: *look up complete definition*, the higher the crest factor the more dynamic a mix.

Traditionally a mastering engineer is sent the printed 2-Track instead of the multitrack. But an exception can be made (STEM mastering and sending the multitrack outright).

Mastering engineers contribute to the overall sound of the finished product. Originally this was purely accidental.

The CD removed many of the technical limitations of vinyl. The time limit remained but low frequency and volume restrictions lightened up. But mastering engineers still remained in the process.


## Pro vs DIY Mastering
### Professional

There is a level of acoustic scrutiny that is a step beyond a mixing studio. There needs to be near dead silence. They are much smaller setups and have much higher fidelity monitors.

Done by someone who did not have any involvement in recording or mixing.

Painstakingly constructed studios. Mostly insert based with some parallel.

### DIY
