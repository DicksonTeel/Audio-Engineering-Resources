# Preproduction, Session Planning, Documentation and Pro Tools Skills
*Preproduction (What’s the Expectation?)*

### Administrative

- Try for physical meetings.
- Contact Info (Name, email, phone, possible address)(post-intention establishment).
- Studio Policies (is a powerful thing that should be known up front).
	- Studio Rates (Market research, how much do you feel you are worth, how much do you need to keep the lights on).
	- Deposits/Cancellations/Payments -
		- If there can’t be a deposit, they’re not a legit client. (Like a down payment)(“I’ll need a small deposit to secure the time.”)
		- Cancellation policies differ, but should be told to prospective clients.
		- Pay-as-you-go: if we work for 6 hours, pay me at the end of the six hours (also talked about up front)
	- Release of “masters”.
	- General Conduct.
- P.O. numbers - Purchase Order. Where one business has a written terms agreement with another business.

### Engineering: the technical process

- Band info (who, instrumentation, how many people).
- Song info (how many, kind of song).
- Instrument info (Pics/vids, range from sophisticated to simple, possible intonation).
- Previous Experience/Recording style - what was their previous recording experience, how did they do their last recordings.
- Gear and Resource allocation.
- Headphone mixes.
- Materials (drum heads, strings, sticks, picks, hard drives, etc.).
- File Types (mixed projects (working with other engineers/daws), sample rates or the recorded file format).

### Production: the artistic process

- Role of a producer
	- Overseer of the project, bringing each aspect together.
	- Song Choice (which songs go into an album).
	- Style and instrumentation (genre of song).
	- Arrangement, key, tempo.
	- Melody, harmony, lyrical adjustments.
	- Beats, patterns, drum loops.
	- Sourcing/hiring session musicians.
- Attending rehearsals.

### Session Planning

- Studio layout
- Equipment list
- Mic list

Sometimes the engineer plans the session, sometimes the engineer is handed that plan and is tasked with set and check.

### Documentation

- It is Standard Procedure to document all setups and mixes
	- Mic, mic pre, any processing on the input path; in case you need to punch at a later date.
	- Any analog or digital outboard gear use.
- DAWs do most/all of this for us if the workflow is entirely In The Box.

### Pro Tools Skills

- Basics (search the PDF)
	- Session creation (Dashboard).
	- Track creation (tracks).
	- I/O Settings (inputs)
	- Grouping tracks (grouping tracks) (during recording is for letting pro tools know that things are phase related).
	- Markers (Memory Locations).
	- Playlists (playlists)

- Punching in/out
	- 4 pieces of info are needed
		- In point - where recording will begin.
		- Out point - where recording will end.
		- Pre roll - lead in so artist can find their place.
		- Post roll - never want to punch out by pressing stop.
	- Be sure Quick-punch is on (specific to Pro Tools)
	- Manual Punch - you do it all
	- Auto Punch - you tell PT what to do
- Sometimes you have an “in” without a defined out; “pick it up from…” (only need 2 points of info (preroll and in))
