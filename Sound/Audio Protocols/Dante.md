**Dante (developed and supported by Audinate) stands for Digital Audio Network Through Ethernet**

All Dante devices discover each other automatically; and, because Dante is a standardized specification, Dante devices are truly plug-and-play once the system is set up.

Setting up a Dante network is not much different from setting up a home-based network.
In a typical system, devices plug into an Ethernet switch (similar to your Wi-Fi router), and your computer connects to the network. Audinate’s Dante Controller application manages the system, routes audio among Dante-enabled devices, checks network status and bandwidth usage, and keeps track of firmware updates from Dante product manufacturers (not just Audinate). This makes it easy to keep the system hardware up to date.

Dante networks move digital audio over hundreds of feet (and more) using Cat 5e (or higher depending on situational factors) cables or fiber-optic cables. It is recommended that any network hardware used for a Dante network be capable of Gigabyte speeds. And, because the data is digital, there’s no deterioration as it moves around the network.

A Dante network requires Dante-compatible devices that can connect to the network. This can be something as simple as a headphone amp that hooks into the network for remote monitoring or as involved as a full-blown audio interface or stage box that routes mic- and line-level signals from a stage performance to the network. The networked audio can then go simultaneously to multiple places: the front of house for mixing, remote speakers in a lobby, the green room, a Dante audio recorder for archiving, and to the technical director in the video control center.

*Perhaps Dante’s best feature is that you don’t need to be an IT professional to set it up and have devices talk to each other. A lot of effort has gone into ensuring the kind of compatibility that improves productivity rather than slowing you down.*
