# Intro to Audio and the Industry

## Audio Production

- Traditional studio productions have a specific pattern of activities.
- Production has 2 different tracks now-a-days, traditional pro studios and home studios.
- Important and critical aspects and decisions made in the process aren’t always easily changed later.

## The Tools

- Multitrack recorder
	- Where individual “parts” are recorded.
	- Individual selection of which tracks are in playback and which are recording.
		- The DAW editor window is the modern digital equivalent.
- 2-Track recorder
	- Condenses the mix to a more finished work (“export audio”).
- Microphone
	- Capture sound (takes air pressure and converts it to electrical volts).
- Console
	- Allows for the mic signal to get to the multitrack.
	- Allows for adjustments to be made to levels from individual mic’s and from individual tracks playing from the multitrack.
	- Mixes the track together.
	- Allows to listen through monitors.
	- Is segmented into separate channels.

## From Studio to Consumer

- Pre production
- Recording
	- Basic tracks
	- Overdubs
- Mixing
- Mastering
- Manufacturing, distribution, etc.

## Recording Process

1. Tracking
	- What gets recorded first.
	- Typically it’s:
		- Rhythm instruments (drums/bass/rhythm guitar) w/…
		- scratch (a track that will be replaced later) (syn: ref, guide); vocals, guitars, bass, keys, anything can be scratch.
		- Often requires several “takes”.
		- Comp’ing (compile/composite) - takes the best of all takes and forms a composite performance.
2. Overdubs
	- Playback the basic tracks
	- Record additional instrument on unused track
	- Repeat for additional instruments
3. Punching-in/out
	- If a take is almost perfect, it is possible to re-record part of the take as needed.
	- Playback up to the part to replace is called Pre Roll.
	- Record only the part you want to replace and only on the tracks you need to fix.
	- Allows for perfecting of a take.
4. Editing
	- Comp’ing is a form of editing.
5. Mixing
	- Individual adjustment of each tracks:
		- Volume (relative)
		- Spatial position
		- Tone
		- Add effects
		- Sum together to 2-track
6. Mastering
	- From the 2-track
		- *STEMS are sub mixes created from the multitrack*
	- Make each song sound the best it can in and of itself
	- Make all songs on album cohesive, like they should go together (not story; volume, eq, etc.).
	- Creates Production Master (2-track compressed to 1-track).
