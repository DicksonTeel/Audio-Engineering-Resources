## Cubase

Cubase is a digital audio workstation (DAW) developed by Steinberg for music and MIDI recording, arranging and
editing. The first version, which was originally only a MIDI sequencer and ran on the Atari ST computer, was released
in 1989. Cut-down versions of Cubase are included with almost all Yamaha audio and MIDI hardware, as well as hardware
from other manufacturers. These versions can be upgraded to a more advanced version at a discount.

### Editions

When Cubase 6 was released in 2011, Steinberg introduced 5 different editions for different levels of use. From highest
to lowest they are: Cubase (now known as Cubase Pro), Cubase Artist, Cubase Elements, Cubase AI and Cubase LE. They have
all been updated as new versions come out. While they all run on the same audio engine, the lower tiers have limits on
the number of certain types of tracks. The number of audio tracks allowed in Cubase Pro is unlimited, Artist: 64,
Elements: 48, AI: 32, LE: 16.

As of March 2022, Cubase has reached release version 12.

### History

Cubase has existed in three main incarnations. Initially Cubase, which featured only MIDI, and which was available on
the Atari ST, Macintosh and Windows.

After a brief period with audio integration, the next version, Cubase VST, featured fully integrated audio recording and
mixing along with effects. It added Virtual Studio Technology (VST) support, a standard for audio plug-ins, which led to
a plethora of third-party effects, both freeware and commercial. Cubase VST was only for Macintosh and Windows; Atari
support had been effectively dropped by this time, despite such hardware still being a mainstay in many studios. Cubase
VST was offering a tremendous amount of power to the home user, but computer hardware took some time to catch up. By the
time it did, VST's audio editing ability was found to be lacking, when compared with competitors such as Pro Tools DAE
and Digital Performer MAS.

To address this, a new version of the program, Cubase SX (based on Steinberg's flagship post-production software Nuendo)
was introduced, which dramatically altered the way the program ran. This version required much relearning for users of
older Cubase versions. However, once the new methods of working were learned, the improvements in handling of audio and
automation made for a more professional sequencer and audio editor.

A notable improvement with the introduction of Cubase SX was the advanced audio editing, especially the ability to '
undo' audio edits. Early versions of Cubase VST did not have this ability. Cubase SX also featured real-time
time-stretching and adjustment of audio tempo, much like Sonic Foundry's ground-breaking ACID.

In September 2006 Steinberg announced Cubase 4 - the successor to Cubase SX3. Notable new features include 'control
room', a feature designed to help create monitor mixes, and a new set of VST3 plug-ins and instruments.

There are also lighter economic alternatives by Steinberg, originally named Cubasis, later becoming Cubase SE and then
Cubase Essential at version 4. For its sixth generation, the program was renamed Cubase Elements 6. The name change was
done presumably, because its rival Cakewalk had taken the Essential branding for its own entry-level DAW software, Sonar
X1 Essential. While the full version of Cubase features unlimited audio and MIDI tracks, lesser versions have limits.
For instance, Cubase Elements 6 has a maximum of 48 audio track and 64 MIDI tracks and Cubase Artist 6 offer 64
audio and 128 MIDI tracks.

In 2013, Steinberg introduced Cubasis for iPad, a Cubase for iOS. This version was a full rewrite and supports MIDI and
audio tracks, audiobus and virtual MIDI to work with external music apps from the first versions. In 2016, Cubasis 2
was released as a free update with new features such as real-time time-stretching, pitch-shifting for changing the key,
a "channel strip" effects suite, and new plug-ins and sounds. In 2017, Steinberg received the MIPA (Musikmesse
International Press Award) for Cubasis 2 in the Mobile Music App category at the Musikmesse in Frankfurt. In late
2019, Cubasis 3 followed as a new app and included group tracks, a "Master Strip" effects suite, a revamped MediaBay,
more effects and many more features in addition to iPhone support. In mid-2020, Cubasis 3 was released for Android
tablets and smartphones.

## Neundo

Nuendo is a digital audio workstation (DAW) developed by Steinberg for music recording, arranging, editing and
post-production. The package is aimed at audio and video post-production market segments (marketed as an 'Advanced Audio
Post-Production System', in contrast to Steinberg's other DAW software, Cubase, which is marketed as an 'Advanced Music
Production System'), but also contains optional modules that can be used for multiple multimedia creation and audio
sequencing.

### History

The first version of Nuendo was released by Steinberg in the year 2000. Version 2 followed in 2003, introducing
multiple aspects of functionality previously found in the SX version of Steinberg's other DAW, Cubase, at the time.

Version 3 of Nuendo was released in 2005, shortly after the sale of Steinberg to the Japanese multinational corporation
and conglomerate, Yamaha. It was the first version of the software to support the AAF file format.

Version 4 (September 2007) introduced a new automation system and new VST3 format plug-ins; version 5 (July 2010)
added new tools for ADR and sound design; and version 6 (September 2013) included new loudness metering and a new
mixing console.

Nuendo version 7 was first previewed at the Game Developers Conference in March 2015, then released in June 2015.
It introduced a feature known as Game Audio Connect, allowing for direct transfer of audio assets using Audiokinetic's
Wwise middleware.

Version 8 of Nuendo was released in June 2017, featuring version 2 of the Game Audio Connect functionality, sound
randomization, and new offline processing features.

Version 10 had been announced and previewed at GDC 2019 in San Francisco on 20â€“22 March 2019, then released on 24
April 2019

Version 12 was released on August 3rd, 2022.
