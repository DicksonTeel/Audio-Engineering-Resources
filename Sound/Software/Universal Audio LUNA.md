Universal Audio, Inc. was founded alongside the United Recording Corporation by Bill Putnam Sr. in 1958. Putnam’s
intention was for Universal Audio to serve as United’s manufacturing arm, with the company initially operating out of
the United Recording premises at 6050 Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California. During its first few years Universal
Audio produced a number of tube-based audio processors, the most famous being the 610 preamplifier. These processors
also served as components in custom recording consoles built by Universal Audio for various studios.

In 1961, United Recording acquired Studio Supply Co. and rebranded it as the Studio Electronics Corporation (SEC). The
focus of SEC was the creation of fully-fledged studio systems built around the equipment produced by Universal Audio. In
October, 1961, all manufacturing was moved to Western Recorders, a nearby company in which United Recording had gained a
majority stake.

While Universal Audio as a company was eventually absorbed by Studio Electronics in December, 1965, the brand itself
continued with individual products retaining the Universal Audio label. Studio Electronics acquired two additional
brands in 1967: Teletronix and Waveforms. The acquisition of Teletronix from Babcock allowed SEC to begin
production of the popular LA-2A compressor. Waveforms on the other hand expanded the product catalog into the area
of precision audio test instruments. In light of these acquisitions, and in the anticipation of more, SEC was
rebranded as United Recording Electronics Industries (UREI). Products would continue to carry their own brand names
alongside the UREI badge until the mid-1970s, at which point the Universal Audio label was removed from Revision H
of the 1176 compressor.

In 1999, Universal Audio (UA) was reestablished by Bill and Jim Putnam, the sons of Bill Putnam, Sr.. A software-based
sister company, Kind of Loud Technologies, was also co-founded by Bill Putnam, Jr. and Jonathan Abel, who had met at
Stanford University through the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. The two companies merged to offer
both hardware re-issues of classic Universal Audio and Teletronix recording products, and virtual emulations of audio
equipment from a range of manufacturers, including officially-branded emulations of original UA and Teletronix products.

UA introduced its line of Apollo audio interfaces in 2012. These interfaces offered onboard DSP that allowed signals to
be monitored in realtime through UA plugins. Subsequent models of Apollo also incorporated a technology called Unison,
which improved the authenticity of preamp emulations by matching both the impedance of the original hardware and
its gain level "sweet spots".

At Winter NAMM 2020, UA announced that it would expand its Console software into a fully-featured DAW called LUNA. The
software will be freely available to all owners of Thunderbolt Apollo interfaces.
