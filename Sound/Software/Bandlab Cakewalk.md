Cakewalk by BandLab is a full-featured Digital Audio Workstation software package for audio and MIDI composing,
recording, arranging, editing, mixing and mastering. It is developed and published under a free subscription licensing
model by BandLab Technologies of Singapore for the Microsoft Windows platform.

Sonar was the final flagship product of Cakewalk, Inc. of Boston, MA. After 30 years of operation, Cakewalk, Inc. was
dissolved in November 2017 by its parent company, Gibson Brands. At this time, Gibson ceased all development and support
of Cakewalk software with only the licensing and support forum servers kept running.

In February 2018, BandLab Technologies announced that it had purchased all of Cakewalk, Inc.â€™s intellectual property and
some of its assets. BandLab's stated goal was continued development of the former company's flagship product, SONAR (now
renamed Cakewalk by BandLab) as part of its portfolio of freeware digital audio workstation software. BandLab continues
to maintain the old Cakewalk, Inc. licensing servers as a courtesy to owners of legacy products.
