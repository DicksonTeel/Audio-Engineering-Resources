WaveLab is a digital audio editor and recording computer software application for Windows and macOS, created by
Steinberg. WaveLab was started in 1995 and it is mainly the work of one programmer, Philippe Goutier. Audio can be
edited as a single file, a series of files or a multitrack "montage". It fully supports VST 2 and 3 plugins for
audio processing. Cut-down versions of WaveLab are available as WaveLab Elements and WaveLab LE.
