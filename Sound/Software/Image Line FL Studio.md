FL Studio (previously known as FruityLoops before 2003) is a digital audio workstation (DAW) developed by the
Belgian company Image-Line. It features a graphical user interface with a pattern-based music sequencer. The
program is available in four different editions for Microsoft Windows and macOS. Image-Line also develops FL Studio
Mobile for Android, iOS, macOS and Universal Windows Platform devices.

FL Studio can also be used as either a Virtual Studio Technology (VST) or Audio Unit (AU) instrument in other audio
workstation programs and also functions as a ReWire client. Image-Line also offers its own VST and AU instruments
and audio applications. FL Studio has been used by numerous highly visible hip hop and EDM producers, including
Metro Boomin, Porter Robinson, Alan Walker, Madeon, Soulja Boy, Southside, Martin Garrix, Avicii, Imanbek, Lex
Luger and Deadmau5.

The first version of FruityLoops was developed by Didier Dambrin and was partially released on December 18, 1997.
Its official launch was in early 1998, when it was still a four-channel MIDI drum machine.
Dambrin became Chief Software Architect for the program, and it quickly underwent a series of large upgrades
that made it into a popular and complex digital audio workstation.

FruityLoops was renamed to "FL Studio" in mid 2003, after the threat of a lawsuit from Kellogg's and to improve the
software's marketability. Software piracy was a major issue in the company's early days, and it took nearly 5
years for the company to earn money from users purchasing legitimate licenses.

On May 22, 2018, a macOS-compatible version of FL Studio was released.

### Editions

FL Studio comes in several editions with different levels of functionality. The free trial version includes all of
the program's features, all plugins, and allows users to render project audio to WAV, MIDI, MP3, and OGG.
Projects saved while in demo mode, however, can only be opened once FL Studio and its plugins have been registered.
Also, instrument presets cannot be saved and the audio output of some instruments will cut out momentarily every
few minutes until the program and its plugins have been registered.

#### Fruity Edition

The Fruity Edition allows users to access the playlist, piano roll, and event automation features, which allow for
complex and lengthy arranging and sequencing. There is also VST/ReWire support so that FL Studio can be an
instrument in other hosts such as Cubase, Sonic Solutions, and Logic. As of version 21.0.3, this edition includes
84 instruments and effects; it does not support audio recording and the use of audio clips.

#### Producer Edition

The Producer Edition includes all of the features of the Fruity Edition, as well as full audio recording for
internal and external audio and post-production tools. It allows for hand-drawing point and curve based splines
(referred to as "automation clips"). Plugins include Edison, Slicex (loop slicer and re-arranger), Sytrus, Maximus,
Vocodex and Synthmaker. It also allows for waveform viewing of audio clips and the ability to add cue points.

#### Signature Bundle

This edition includes the Producer Edition as well as a series of plugins such as the Fruity Video Player,
DirectWave Sampler, Harmless, NewTone, Pitcher, Gross Beat and the Hardcore Guitar Effects Suite.

#### All Plugins Edition

The All Plugins Edition includes the Signature Bundle along with extra plugins, particularly synthesizers.

#### Mobile

On June 21, 2011, Image-Line released FL Studio Mobile for iOS and in April 2013 for Android. Both support the
ability to create multi-track projects on mobile devices including iPod Touches, iPhones, iPads, Android 2.3.3 and
higher smartphones and tablets.

#### Groove

On September 2, 2013, a new standalone app for Windows 8 was released. It is a Groovebox-style application
optimised for touch-based music creation.
