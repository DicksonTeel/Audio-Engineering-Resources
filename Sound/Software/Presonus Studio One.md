Studio One is a digital audio workstation (DAW) application, used to create, record, mix and master music and other
audio, with functionality also available for video. Initially developed as a successor to the KRISTAL Audio Engine,
it was acquired by PreSonus and first released in 2009 for macOS and Microsoft Windows.

In addition to the commercial editions of the software (known as Studio One Artist and Studio One Professional),
PreSonus also distributes a free edition, with reduced functionality (known as Studio One Prime). The Professional
edition is also available as part of the Studio One+ monthly subscription program.

### Early development and release (2004–2011)

Studio One originally began development under the name K2, as a follow-up to the KRISTAL Audio Engine. Although
development for this follow-up began in 2004, it transitioned in 2006 to a cooperation between PreSonus and
KristalLabs Software Ltd., a start-up founded by former Steinberg employees Wolfgang Kundrus and Matthias Juwan.
Kundrus was one of the developers for initial versions of Cubase, and established concepts for the first version of
Nuendo. Juwan was the author of the original KRISTAL Audio Engine, wrote the specification for version 3 of the VST
plug-in standard, and had also worked on multiple Steinberg products, including Cubase, Nuendo, and HALion.

KristalLabs then became part of PreSonus in 2009, and the former KristalLabs logo was used as the basis for the logo
of Studio One.

The first version of Studio One was announced on 1 April 2009 at Musikmesse, and released on 27 September 2009. The
final update for Studio One version 1 (v1.6.5) was released in July 2011.

### Versions 2 & 3 (2011–2018)

Version 2 of Studio One was announced on 17 October 2011, and released on 31 October 2011 (alongside the 2.0.2
update). This release of the software introduced multiple enhancements, including integration with Celemony
Melodyne, transient detection & quantization, groove extraction, multi-track comping, folder tracks, multi-track MIDI
editing, an updated browser, and new plug-ins.

The integration of Studio One version 2 with Melodyne was achieved via the creation of a new plug-in extension, known as
Audio Random Access (ARA). This extension, developed jointly by PreSonus and Celemony, allows an audio plug-in to appear
as an integrated part of the application.

Version 3 of Studio One was released on 20 May 2015. The new features included an arranger track, scratchpads for
idea experimentation, the ability to chain together different effects and instruments, MIDI note effects, new plug-ins,
and the ability to use curves in automation.

### Versions 4 & 5 (2018–2022)

Following teaser images on social media websites in the preceding weeks, version 4 of Studio One was announced via a
YouTube live stream event on 22 May 2018, and released simultaneously. New features in version 4 included a chord
track (with chord detection, transposition and chord substitution options), a dedicated drum editing interface,
expanded drum machine & sampler plug-ins, AAF-format import/export functionality (to exchange data with other DAW
applications), and support for version 2 of the ARA plug-in extension.

Almost exactly a year later, on 21 May 2019, this functionality was expanded further with the live stream announcement
and simultaneous release of version 4.5. New functionality introduced with version 4.5 included input channel gain
staging and phase/polarity options, a built-in plug-in manager, M4A (AAC/ALAC) support, video export options, new
grouping options, RMS metering, pre-fader metering, CPU multi-core optimization, and expanded macro features, alongside
a new add-on for batch audio conversion & processing.

The release of version 4.6 was preceded by a launch party event, hosted by PreSonus at the Red Bull Studios building in
London. Its release on 10 December 2019 included a re-designed and expanded version of the 'Ampire' guitar amplifier
and effects plugin (including new effects pedal options), a re-designed content browser, and new templates & macros for
podcast production.

Version 5 of Studio One, described as "ten years in the making", was announced via live-stream video on 7 July 2020.
Features added in this new version included a full score editor (with features similar to that of PreSonus'
notation software, Notion), a 'Show’ interface focused on supporting live performances, MIDI support enhancements
(such as polyphonic expression, custom ROLI device support, and the ability to use MTC & MMC to synchronize Studio
One with external clocks). Version 5 also added support for recording in 64-bit floating-point WAV format, bringing
the maximum precision for recording & processing to 64-bit/384 kHz and thereby making Studio One one of the
highest-resolution audio production and mastering applications available. Version 5.4 of the software,
released in September 2021, added native support for Apple computers with Apple silicon chips, thereby providing
improved performance on such machines (which would previously have run the application via 'Rosetta 2' emulation).

### Version 6 (2022)

Version 6 of the software (the first following PreSonus' acquisition by Fender in 2021) was both announced and
released on 29 September 2022. The new release included enhancements focused on making the application
"simpler and more intuitive" (as previously alluded to by Fender CEO, Andy Mooney), such as "smart" templates,
additional UI customization, song lyric support, and cloud-based collaboration (via their PreSonus Sphere
subscription service). Following the launch, Evan Jones, Fender CMO, stated that the company was "fully
invested in supporting the continued expansion and adoption of Studio One as the total solution for professional
and committed at-home creators." In addition, version 6 introduced a video track with basic editing tools.
