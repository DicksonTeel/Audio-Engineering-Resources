In 2011, Shure previewed Axient, a wireless management network, which includes features for spectrum management,
interference detection and avoidance, frequency diversity, remote control (including remote configuration of
wireless units via the 2.4 GHz "Zigbee" WPAN IEEE 802.15.4 based "Showlink" protocol) and the use of Li-ion
rechargeable batteries to eliminate the use of ordinary AA and AAA batteries.

Shure also previewed "Wireless Workbench" software in conjunction with Axient. This was a desktop application for
Mac and Windows designed to monitor and control networked Shure wireless systems, as well as provide tools to
coordinate and deploy compatible frequencies. Since its initial release, the application has received numerous
updates, and is now available to download for free from Shure's website.
