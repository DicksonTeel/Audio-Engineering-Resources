REAPER (an acronym for Rapid Environment for Audio Production, Engineering, and Recording) is a digital audio
workstation and MIDI sequencer application created by Cockos. The current version is available for Microsoft Windows (XP
and newer) and macOS (10.5 and newer), as well as for Linux. REAPER acts as a host to most industry-standard
plug-in formats (such as VST and AU) and can import all commonly used media formats, including video. REAPER and its
included plug-ins are available in 32-bit and 64-bit format.

Extensive customization opportunities are provided through the use of ReaScript (edit, run and debug scripts within
REAPER) and user-created themes and functionality extensions.

ReaScript can be used to create anything from advanced macros to full-featured REAPER extensions. ReaScripts can be
written in EEL2 (JSFX script), Lua and Python. SWS / S&M is a popular, open-source extension to REAPER, providing
workflow enhancements and advanced tempo/groove manipulation functionality.

ReaClassical provides a full open source environment for doing classical music editing, including source-destination
editing, multitrack track-group editing and a two-lane crossfade editor.

REAPER's interface can be customized with user-built themes. Each previous version's default theme is included with
REAPER and theming allows for complete overhauls of the GUI. REAPER has been translated into multiple languages and
downloadable language packs are available. Users as well as developers can create language packs for REAPER.

REAPER comes with a variety of commonly used audio production effects. They include tools such as ReaEQ, ReaVerb,
ReaGate, ReaDelay, ReaPitch and ReaComp. The included Rea-plug-ins are also available as a separate download for users
of other DAWs, as the ReaPlugs VST FX Suite.

Also included are hundreds of JSFX plug-ins ranging from standard effects to specific applications for MIDI and
audio. JSFX scripts are text files, which when loaded into REAPER (exactly like a VST or other plug-in) become
full-featured plug-ins ranging from simple audio effects (e.g delay, distortion, compression) to instruments (synths,
samplers) and other special purpose tools (drum triggering, surround panning). All JSFX plug-ins are editable in any
text editor and thus are fully user customizable.

REAPER's only instruments are Reasynth, Reasyndr & Reasamplomatic5000. Reasynth is a basic synth with wave shape, ADSR
Envelope & Portamento. Reasyndr has 4 drum samples. A kick, snare, blip & tick. And Reasamplomatic5000 is a sampler. But
many people still say that REAPER has no instruments despite these anyways.

REAPER includes no third-party software, but is fully compatible with all versions of the VST standard (currently VST2
and VST3). It can also run AU plug-ins (on macOS), CLAP plug-ins, DX plug-ins (on Windows) and LV2 plug-ins, and
thus works with the vast majority of both free and commercial plug-ins available. REAPER x64 can also run 32-bit
plug-ins alongside 64-bit processes. As of version 5.97, REAPER supports ARA 2 plugins.

While not a dedicated video editor, REAPER can be used to cut and trim video files and to edit or replace the audio
within. Common video effects such as fades, wipes and cross-fades are available. REAPER aligns video files in a project,
as it would an audio track, and the video part of a file can be viewed in separate video window while working on the
project.
