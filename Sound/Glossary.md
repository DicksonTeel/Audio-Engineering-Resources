| Synthesis & Audio Terms | Description |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| Subtractive | Sounds are created by filtering and modifying a harmonically rich waveform |
| Additive | Sine wave components are added to build up a waveform |
| FM Synthesis | Frequency Modulation, carrier frequencies are used to affect or modulate root waveforms |
| Sampling | Recordings of sound are used as the waveform source |
| Wavetable | Short repeating waveforms are used as a sound source, with more variety and Sine, Triangle, & Square waves |
| Virtual Instrument| A computer based program used to emulate a physical device, like a synthesizer or other instrument |
| Plugin | A software addition to a host program that expands the capabilities of the host software |
| Modulation | One thing affecting/controlling another, a control source routed to a destination |
| Envelope | Controls time and level of an aspect of sound i.e. volume |
| Filter | Modifies some tonal portion of a sound i.e. Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass, Shelving, etc. |
| Equalization / EQ | Tone or frequency adjustments made to a signal |
| Parametric EQ | Tone control with 3 adjustable parameters: Frequency, Amplitude, and Width (aka Quality control or Q factor) |
