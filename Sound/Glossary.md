| Musical Element | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Pitch | The frequency of a note. Given in Hertz or musical note values such as A4, which equals 440Hz |
| Timbre | Tone, the sonic characteristics of a sound |
| Volume | Loudness or amplitude, measured in decibles |
| Tempo | Speed or pace of music, commonly designated in BPM |
| Sine Wave | The basic building block of all sound. A fundamental or root pitch with *no* harmonics |
| Harmonic series | Frequencies that are integer multiples of the root frequency: root x2, root x3, root x4, etc. also known as Overtones or Partials. Harmonics have a linear relationship |
