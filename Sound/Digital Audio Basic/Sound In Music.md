- “A-440” is a tuning reference… an “A” note vibrates at 440Hz.
- 1 octave is double/half the starting frequency.
- There are about 10 octaves in the standard range of human hearing (20-20k).
- Linear change can be represented by + or -
- Exponential change can be represented by x or /
- Volume is measure exponentially.
- Octaves are related exponentially.
- Harmonics are related linearly.
- Harmonics are found by adding the root frequency to itself.
- All octaves will be harmonic but all harmonics will not be octaves.
- Frequencies that the venue “likes” will not (using common sense) cause feedback, and the room will be sympathetic to that frequency. Frequencies that a venue “doesn’t like” will cause feedback and its harmonics are likely to cause issues as well.
- Vibrato: a periodic change in pitch
- Tremolo: periodic change in volume
- Doppler effect - *Look up / check glossary*
- 0dB-A is considered the threshold of hearing
- 120dB-A is considered the threshold of pain
- RF - Radio Frequency
- The purpose of a balanced connection is to remove as much outside/unwanted noise from the signal as possible.
