# Digital Audio *Large Glossary Usage*

- PCM - Pulse Code Modulation
- Sample Rate - how often the waveform is sampled. More is better as there are more data points allowing for a more accurately depicted sound. Higher sample rates require a faster converter and processor.
- Nyquist Theory: one must sample at least twice the target frequency.
- CD Sample Rate: 44.1kHz
- DVD Sample Rate: 96kHz
- Digital Video Sample Rate: 48kHz
- DVD-A (HD Audio) Sample Rate: 192kHz
- Aliasing: capturing sound that isn’t actually there.


- Binary Digit = Bit
- Nybble = 4 bits
- Byte = 8 bits
- Binary aka base - 2 system. 0-1
- Arithmetic aka base - 10 system. 0-9
- Hexadecimal aka base - 16 system. 0-15 {A(10)-F(15)}
- Bit Resolution aka Bit Depth - Glossary
- +6dB (SPL) range per bit (PCM)
- 8-bit recording has avg. accuracy of 1/5th dB
- 16-bit recording has avg. accuracy of 1/650th dB
- 24-bit recording has avg. accuracy of 1/100,000th dB


- Sample Rate x Bytes per second x 60 Seconds = Bytes per Track Minute (BPTM)
- 44100 x 2 (16-bit) x 60 = 5Mb per track minute
- 44100 x 3 (24-bit) x 60 = 8Mb per track minute


- Number of tracks x Number of minutes x BPTM
- 24 x 60 x 5 = 7,200Mb (7.2Gb)


- Delta Modulation - *Glossary*
- DSD: Direct Stream Digital - 1 bit recording
- 2.8 million+ sample rate


- Dithering - *Glossary*
	- Adds random noise to low volume signals
	- It preserves “information” to avoid lower signals from cutting out leaving the larger signals to jump in and out.


- Truncation: removing bits when sizing down bit depth.
	- Truncation error: the bits dropped
