# Mastering Concept

Mastering is a separate process from mixing. But technically; mastering is the creation of the production master. *Edison Wax Cylinder*. Now however, we create different kind of masters.

EQ/Filters/Dynamics are carefully applied to make sure everything “fits in”.

Crest Factor: *look up complete definition*, the higher the crest factor the more dynamic a mix.

Traditionally a mastering engineer is sent the printed 2-Track instead of the multitrack. But an exception can be made (STEM mastering and sending the multitrack outright).

Mastering engineers contribute to the overall sound of the finished product.
