## Basic Principles of Acoustics *review BASIC*

Waves - a disturbance or variation that transfers energy from point to point in a medium.

The disturbance could be:

- Variation of pressure.
- Change in electric or magnetic intensity.
- Elastic deformation.

Even though there is a disturbance in the medium, the particles in the medium do not travel with the wave.

Sound can travel through all elastic media I.e. gases, liquids, solids.

**Acoustic Problems in Recording Studios: Sound proofing stops sound from getting in or out. Sound treatment changes the character of the sound, changing the frequency content or reverberations/reflections.**


## Only 3 things will stop / contain sound transmissions (sound proofing):

- Space
	- Putting distance between you and the sound reduces what is heard. Sealed air gaps between solid materials can reduce sound transmission, aka decoupling. Decoupling is the concept of detaching layers in a partition to improve sound isolation.
- Mass
	- Materials with a high density per sq.ft. Reduces sound transmission. The denser an object is, the less it will transmit sound. Limp mass is usually better than rigid mass, though a combination of the 2 offers greater isolation.

- Dampening
	- Soft material will not vibrate and thus not transmit sound well.

The best recipient for soundproofing often uses combinations of all three in one construction in decoupled layers.

**STC - Sound Transmission Class: sound proof rating, the higher the rating the higher the insulation.**

**Resilient Channels: used between the wall surface and stud that adds “flex” to the wall making it less rigid. When a wall is less rigid, it can dampen the sound.**

**Ceilings can be built much like walls but can be limited by; another story/floor, HVAC equipment. But can height be lost without issue?**

**Sound isolation in floors serve 2 purposes: keep sound from entering the studio and to keep outside sound from getting into the studio. The most common construction is to have the floor “float” and within the gap provided by the u-boats allows for cable trowels to be setup.**

***Studios should have as flat a frequency response as possible, acoustical anomalies will make irreversible artifacts into recordings (studio space) or bad decisions (control room). Flat is not dead! A flat response is not about killing all ambiance or reflections in a room. It is about controlling reflections. Dead rooms are tiring to listen and work in.***


## Sound treatments are done through:
- Absorption
	- “Soaking up” of sound by a surface. Depends of material and frequency.
	- Absorption is frequency dependent. Often, surfaces absorb sound only in certain frequency ranges (Hi freq, Low freq, Broadband).
	- 
	- Hi freq
		- Soft, porous surfaces tent to absorb more high frequencies.
		- High frequencies are the easiest to control.
	- Low freq
		- Most difficult to absorb due to their longer wavelengths. In general, flexible absorbers are best (called “bass traps”)
	- Broadband
		- Rigid fiberglass panels, built into a frame, covered with fabric, mounted a distance away from the wall; the distance away from the wall creates an air gap to improve absorption. The rigid panels and air gap can be effective down to 100Hz. The fabric used can affect different frequency ranges.

- Diffusion
	- Intelligently scattering reflections (randomly too).
	- Controlling reflections is a major tool in acoustics so as to not over-deaden a room. Random surfacing can be good.

  

## Problems

1. Sound leakage
	- Sounds getting in or out of the studio / control room / iso booths
	- **Fix**: sound treatment

2. Sound flanking
	- Sound going around unjointed objects
	- **Fix**: sound treatment

3. Room Reverberation
	- RT-60: the time it takes for the reflected sound to drop by 60dB.
	- Depends on the use of the room.
	- A function of the total volume of the room.
	- RT-60 should be consistent in all frequency ranges.
	- **Fix**: sound treatment

4. Early reflections
	- The reflections from the first boundary sound encounters in a space.
	- Helps determine size and nature of a room.
	- Various materials allow for customization to suit the application.
	- These reflections combine with direct sound and cause an altered frequency response.
	- **Fix**: sound treatment

5. Standing waves
	- When sound reflects off of a surface and interferes with the original sound wave from the source.
		- At certain points in the room, some frequencies will partially cancel out (node). And some frequencies will be reinforced (anti node).
		- Axial Modes: modes between 2 parallel surfaces in a room.
		- Tangential Modes: modes along the diagonal of a room.
	- **Fix**: sound treatment

  

## Setting Up a Room

- Control room design:
	- Controlling early reflections.
	- Short RT-60.
	- Flat frequency response is critical.
	- Combination of absorption and diffusion.
	- Room symmetry and speaker placement are very important.

- Room symmetry:
	- Your ears should be the same distance from each speaker. Tweeters at ear height with speakers and ears forming an equilateral triangle.

- ISO booth design:
	- Controlled early reflections.
	- Short RT-60.

- Live room design:
	- Flat frequency response not always desired. Certain areas may be designed to be brighter.
	- Variable acoustics;
		- Baffles, curtains, rugs, reflecting panels.
	- Various materials are often used for their unique characteristics for broadened options when recording.

- Machine room:
	- Soundproofing and noise control is most important.
	- Usually connected to the control room.
	- Must be careful with temperatures and ventilation.
