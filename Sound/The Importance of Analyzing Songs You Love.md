Listening analytically  is invaluable to all of us, whether our interest is songwriting, composing, producing, performing, or egineering. For those of us who work a lot with songs, knowing what's happening when, what to call it, and how to communicate those and other compositional things effectively are important. Awareness of key, form (where we are in the song), melodies, rhythms, istrumentation, and chord progression should be a regular part of our everyday music experience.

Something else that can be overlooed is our emotional attachment to the song we're figuring out. It's usually important that you actually like the song, maybe even love it. This may seem obvious, but sometimes we get trapped into thinking we need to spend a lot of time analyzing music that neither moves nor interests us. Mostly avoid this.
On the other hand, it's always good to listen to a wide variety of music, including that which we think we don't like or are utterly unfamiliar with. Stretch those ears and musical taste! And when you hear something that moves you, figure it out at least a little bit.
